## Installation
```

```

### 3rd Party dependencies
To use the pdf to epub conversion feature, you will need [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download). 
Download and install, no other actions needed. 
If for some reason the app cannot detect calibre's installation directory, make sure the environment variable is set properly! 
[Should be done automatically when installing calibre].

## Running in developer mode
```
npm run dev
```

## Building and packaging for windows
```
npm run build && npm run dist
```
Will output an [**out**] folder in the project directory containing the build files
